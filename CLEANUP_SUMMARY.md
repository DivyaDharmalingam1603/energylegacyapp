# Code Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the code cleanup performed on the EnergyLegacyApp project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Commented-Out Code
- **EnergyConsumptionRepositoryController.cs**: Removed all commented-out legacy controller code
- **PowerPlantRepositoryController.cs**: Removed all commented-out legacy controller code
- These files now contain only a comment indicating the code has been moved to the Business layer

### 2. Fixed Formatting Issues
- **DatabaseHelperController.cs**: 
  - Removed excessive line breaks between statements
  - Standardized indentation and spacing
  - Improved code readability while maintaining functionality

- **EndpointParamStore.cs**:
  - Fixed mixed line endings (CRLF/LF inconsistencies)
  - Removed excessive spacing between methods
  - Standardized formatting throughout the file

- **Program.cs** (Data layer):
  - Removed extra blank lines
  - Improved spacing consistency

- **Program.cs** (Business layer):
  - Cleaned up comments
  - Improved code organization and readability

### 3. Removed Unused Files
- **packages.config**: Removed empty packages.config file that contained no package references

## Files Modified
1. `EnergyLegacyApp.Data\Controllers\EnergyConsumptionRepositoryController.cs`
2. `EnergyLegacyApp.Data\Controllers\PowerPlantRepositoryController.cs`
3. `EnergyLegacyApp.Data\Controllers\DatabaseHelperController.cs`
4. `EnergyLegacyApp.Data\Controllers\EndpointParamStore.cs`
5. `EnergyLegacyApp.Data\Program.cs`
6. `EnergyLegacyApp.Business\Program.cs`

## Files Removed
1. `EnergyLegacyApp.Data\packages.config` (empty file)

## Benefits
- **Improved Readability**: Consistent formatting makes the code easier to read and maintain
- **Reduced Clutter**: Removed commented-out code that was no longer needed
- **Better Organization**: Standardized spacing and indentation across all files
- **Cleaner Repository**: Removed unnecessary files

## Next Steps
Consider removing the legacy controller files entirely once you confirm the migration to the Business layer is complete and all functionality has been properly tested.
